## LXC based Container Service Platform Auto-Deployment Tools
The tool is specifically developed to automate the deployment of RapidsDB, an In-Memory MPP database to LXC based containers. But it can be easily adapted to fit for deployment of other software.

Following is the major deployment workflow:
- 1st step: buildConfig.sh
- 2nd step: deployVM.sh
- 3rd step: deploy vm 
- 4th step: config cluster
